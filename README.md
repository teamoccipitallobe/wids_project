## **üéØ Project Highlights**

*Developed and trained multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, GNN, LightGBM) to predict an individual‚Äôs sex and ADHD diagnosis based on brain scans.

* Achieved an F1 score of 0.73645 and ranked 8th place on the Kaggle Leaderboard.


* Utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) for model interpretability.


* Applied feature engineering techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and feature selection to optimize model performance.


* Implemented data preprocessing including normalization, handling missing values, and balancing classes using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

This project was a submission to the WiDS Datathon 2025. The Break Through Tech AI Program, a program sponsored by Cornell Tech, entered its participants into this Kaggle competition as part of its curriculum with the goal of improving machine learning skills and helping with the challenge itself. The objective of the challenge was to use machine learning to predict an individual‚Äôs sex and ADHD diagnosis. As girls with ADHD are more likely to go undiagnosed, an ML model that can predict both sex and ADHD based on brain scans could be extremely helpful in piecing together the factors that lead to ADHD and how they relate to an individual‚Äôs gender. Early diagnoses can make a huge difference in treatment, and being able to accurately predict ADHD could help girls get the diagnoses they need when doctors may otherwise wave their symptoms away.
