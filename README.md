## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**WiDS challenge:**

1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
