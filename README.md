## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

This project was a submission to the WiDS Datathon 2025. The Break Through Tech AI Program, a program sponsored by Cornell Tech, entered its participants into this Kaggle competition as part of its curriculum with the goal of improving machine learning skills and helping with the challenge itself. The objective of the challenge was to use machine learning to predict an individual‚Äôs sex and ADHD diagnosis. As girls with ADHD are more likely to go undiagnosed, an ML model that can predict both sex and ADHD based on brain scans could be extremely helpful in piecing together the factors that lead to ADHD and how they relate to an individual‚Äôs gender. Early diagnoses can make a huge difference in treatment, and being able to accurately predict ADHD could help girls get the diagnoses they need when doctors may otherwise wave their symptoms away.

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

Some of the brain activity patterns associated with ADHD include deficits in the prefrontal cortex and various disruptions in areas that are part of the default mode network. However, these prefrontal cortex deficits are often more common in males, while the DMN alterations might be more common in females. In males, the brain activity patterns might lead to more hyperactivity due to changes in executive areas, while in females, more connectivity in the DMN and some emotion-processing regions is likely to lead to different symptoms, often more inattentive-type ADHD or anxiety and depression.

This work can contribute by helping to find some of these differences. Since large swaths of ADHD research have historically been focused on males, bringing attention to the brain activity patterns of females with ADHD could help close the gap in diagnosis and fix the system issues that have led to a lack of attention for women with ADHD.

üèê Project Overview
This project was a submission to the WiDS Datathon 2025, as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program at Cornell Tech. The competition aimed to use machine learning to predict an individual‚Äôs sex and ADHD diagnosis based on brain scans. Since girls with ADHD often go undiagnosed, an ML model capable of distinguishing these patterns could assist in earlier and more accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving treatment outcomes.

üìä Data Exploration
Dataset Details:

üé® Impact Narrative
Research indicates that ADHD manifests differently in males and females, with prefrontal cortex deficits more common in males and default mode network (DMN) alterations more prevalent in females. Our work contributes to bridging this knowledge gap by identifying key neurobiological markers associated with ADHD in females.
By improving diagnostic accuracy for ADHD in girls, our model could lead to:
More timely interventions and personalized treatment.


Greater awareness in the medical community about gender differences in ADHD.


Advancing research into sex-based neurodevelopmental variations.



üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements
Enhance Data Augmentation: Apply synthetic data techniques to improve model robustness.


Ensemble Models: Combine multiple models to boost accuracy.


Fine-tune Deep Learning Approaches: Experiment with transformers for medical data.


Ethical Considerations: Conduct fairness audits to ensure unbiased predictions.
